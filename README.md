## Mock-up 

There are a few tools for mock-ups. Paper prototypes (low-tech, but effective and cheap), Digital picture edition software (gimp / photoshop / etc.), or dedicated tools like moqups.com (I'm calling out moqups here in particular since it seems to strike the best balance between "easy-to-use" and "wants your money" -- the free teir isn't perfect, but it should be sufficient for our needs with a little "creative layout" to get around the page-limit)

In this space please either provide images (max 4) showing your prototypes, OR, a link to an online hosted mock-up tool like moqups.com


### Welcome Page
![Welcome page](images/mock-up/welcome_page.png?raw=true "Welcome page")
The "Welcome" Page introduces our site's visitors to the web site they have entered. If the user does not currently have an account, they should navigate to the sign-up page, where it collects user information that will allow them an identity when interacting with the site. Users should create an account with our application because it will allow them to make new posts/comments. 

### Add-an-Animal Page
![Add-an-animal](images/mock-up/add_an_animal.png?raw=true "Add-an-animal")
The "Add-an-animal" Page allows users (that have already created an account and are currently signed in) to upload endangered animal encounters. If approved, the encounter (and, if applicable, user photo) will be listed with the animal's other information when selected from the "Animal-list" Page.

### Animal-List Page
![Animal-list page](images/mock-up/animal_list.png?raw=true "Animal-list page")
This page is one of the core components of our web site: users will be presented with a grid of "Endangered Animal Tiles" with a photo of an endangered animal species and relevant tags beneath it (such as the animal type, location, and/or endangerment level). Upon clicking an animal tile, the current page redirects to another page with more detailed information about the animal (see screenshot below). A user may "favorite" the tile, if desired. These tiles will get more complex as more users add information/pictures for animal species because user information will get updated to each of the tiles to be seen by other users.

### Animal-Profile Page
![Animal-Profile page](images/mock-up/specific_animal.png?raw=true "Animal-list page")
This page is also one of the core components of our web site: users can see more information about the animal -- its tags, species, range, classification, description, post information, recent sightings, and allow users to comment on the post. Authorized user may edit, delete, and add new info to the post.
