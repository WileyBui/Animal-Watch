### Description
Animal Watch is a hub of information about endangered animals, populated by enthusiasts who track sightings of them around the globe.

Users can contribute by monitoring and posting about species that they see in the wild, as well as adding endangered animals to our registry if they are not yet included.

### Welcome Page
![Welcome page](images/demo/WelcomePage.png "Welcome page")
The "Welcome" Page introduces our site's visitors to the web site they have entered. Users can have full access to the site by authenticating with their google user. This will allow them to post and comment.

### Add-an-Animal Page
![Add-an-animal](images/demo/AddAnAnimal.png "Add-an-animal")
The "Add-an-animal" Page allows users currently signed in to upload endangered animal encounters. The encounter (and, if applicable, user photo) will be listed with the animal's other information when selected from the "Animal-Feed" Page.

### Animal-Feed Page
![Animal-Feed page](images/demo/AnimalList.png "Animal-feed page")
This page is one of the core components of our web site: users will be presented with a grid of "Endangered Animal Tiles" with a photo of an endangered animal species and relevant tags beneath it (such as the animal type, location, and/or endangerment level). Upon clicking an animal tile, the current page redirects to another page with more detailed information about the animal (see screenshot below). These tiles will get more complex as more users add information/pictures for animal species because user information will get updated to each of the tiles to be seen by other users.
